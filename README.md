# üöó Car Rental Price Prediction and Optimization

This project develops a **machine learning‚Äìbased predictive model** to forecast car rental prices by analyzing various vehicle, location, and customer factors.  
It aims to optimize pricing strategies in the competitive car rental industry through **data-driven insights and predictive analytics**.

The study compares multiple models ‚Äî **Multiple Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost** ‚Äî and identifies **XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning** as the most accurate algorithm for predicting rental costs.

## üìå Key Objectives

- Build a predictive system for car rental pricing using machine learning.  
- Identify key factors influencing rental prices such as:
  - Vehicle specifications (make, model, year, fuel type)
  - Customer ratings and review counts
  - Location and geographic factors
- Compare multiple machine learning models for accuracy.
- Optimize the top-performing model through **Randomized Search CV** hyperparameter tuning.
- Support **data-driven pricing strategies** for the car rental industry.

## üßÆ Results Summary

| Model | R¬≤ Score | RMSE |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Multiple Regression | 0.577 | 62.45 |
| Random Forest | 0.666 | 55.51 |
| XGBoost | 0.693 | 53.18 |
| **XGBoost (Tuned)** | **0.715** | **51.23** |

‚û°Ô∏è **XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning** achieved the best performance, explaining **71.5% of variance** in rental prices with the lowest prediction error.

## üìà Data Insights

- **Tesla** and **Toyota** dominate the rental market, followed by **BMW** and **Ford**.  
- **Gasoline vehicles** make up **83.5%** of rentals, but **Electric** and **Hybrid** vehicles are steadily growing.  
- **California, Florida, and Texas** lead in rental availability.  
- Vehicle attributes, geographic location, and customer ratings significantly influence pricing.

---

## üß† Key Findings

- **XGBoost** outperforms traditional regression models due to its ability to handle **non-linear relationships** and **feature interactions**.  
- **Feature engineering** and **hyperparameter tuning** significantly improve model accuracy.  
- Machine learning enables **dynamic pricing optimization**, providing car rental companies with actionable insights to balance demand and profitability.

## üîÆ Future Work

- Integrate **real-time data** for dynamic price adjustments.  
- Include **external factors** such as weather, events, or competitor prices.  
- Develop a **Streamlit or Flask dashboard** for live prediction and visualization.  
- Add **sentiment analysis** on customer reviews to refine predictions.
