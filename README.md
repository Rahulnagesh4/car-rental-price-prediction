ðŸš— Car Rental Price Prediction
ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project predicts car rental prices based on multiple vehicle and rental features using machine learning. It leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression modeling to estimate the cost of renting a car accurately.

The project can help rental companies optimize pricing strategies and assist customers in understanding what factors influence rental costs.

ðŸ§  Key Features

Data cleaning and preprocessing of real-world car rental data

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization

Feature selection and engineering

Machine learning model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Model evaluation using performance metrics (RÂ², RMSE, MAE)

Predictive function for new rental data inputs

ðŸ§° Requirements

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


If you donâ€™t have a requirements.txt, you can install the main libraries manually:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn




Run the script:

python car_rental_price_prediction.py


Output:

Trained machine learning model results

Evaluation metrics (RÂ², RMSE, etc.)

Price prediction outputs

ðŸ“Š Example Results
Model	RÂ² Score	RMSE	MAE
Linear Regression	0.82	3.45	2.10
Random Forest	0.89	2.80	1.95

(These are example results; your actual metrics may vary.)

ðŸ“ˆ Future Improvements

Deploy model using Streamlit or Flask for interactive predictions

Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy

Integration with live rental data APIs

Support for more geographic regions
